The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of solving a specific problem using appropriate techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn 

## üìä Features

- Trains one or more ML models on a dataset
- Compares performance between models
- Visualizes important metrics or results
- Concludes with an analysis of model performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/Devanshi678/ML_Model_RBA.git
